      <description>A unique index on a table field, helps developers to ensure that, their table will not have any duplicated values for that field. On the other hand, a soft delete helps us to logically delete a record while keeping the record itself, using a flag field (for example IsDeleted boolean field) in the table. The problems arise when you want to add a record that its unique indexed field value, has been already used in a deleted record.</description>
